NOTE: All programs require at least Java 7 installed.

WellsRelationSolver takes input from either a file or on the command line.
Compile: javac WellsRelationSolver.java
Usage: java WellsRelationSolver [<filepath>]
Example: java WellsRelationSolver Relation.txt
If no file is given, the program will prompt for input for the universe size and for each relation. It accepts most forms of crazy input, and terminates input upon reading a period (.) from the user.

WellsRelationTester depends on the jsch library included with my submission. It takes a username and password on the command line and attempts to log into Andrew to test WellsRelationSolver against your programs.
Compile: javac WellsRelationTester.java -classpath ".;./jsch-0.1.51.jar"
Usage: java -jar ./jsch-0.1.51.jar WellsRelationTester <username>[@<host> [<password>]]
Example: java -jar ./jsch-0.1.51.jar WellsRelationTester Wellsm2011
Example: java -jar ./jsch-0.1.51.jar WellsRelationTester Wellsm2011@andrew.cs.fit.edu my_password
If no password is given, the program will prompt for a password. If no host is given, the program will assume andrew.cs.fit.edu as the host. Once connected, the program will attempt to run each of your programs 25 times starting with a relation of universe size 10 and scaling all the way to universe size 250.

Solver.exe and Tester.exe are executable JAR files which can be run on Windows (or under Wine on Unix).
Solver.exe will run WellsRelationSolver and expect command line input for the relation.
Tester.exe has been set up with my TRACKS username and password so it will automatically connect and perform tests without any input.
